# Next Steps

    * stop criterium (what's a viable coalition?)
    * sampling scheme
    * likelihood estimation
    * output data format
    * config scheme (YAML)
    * opinion weighting -> incl. how to compute (e.g. similarity?)

    -> Module
    -> apply to future elections

# Notes

    * we need to define utility / payoff
        * distance between coalition opinion and initial party opinion (or initial individual opinion)


# Further Down the Road

    * opinion variability within group  // DISCUSS -> probably later
