# Next Milestones

    * first working model  // DONE
        * meeting sequencing protocol  // DISCUSS
        * first iteration: complete mixing + only two groups meet  // DONE
        * parameter ideas:
            * opinion variability within group  // DISCUSS -> probably later
            * delegation size  // DONE

    * set conditions for a coalition
        * narrow and broad version (all elected parties vs. parties with realistic chances for government participation)
        * create framework to scan parameter space
        * formalize model \w pen and paper


# Notes

    * we need to define utility / payoff
        * distance between coalition opinion and initial party opinion (or initial individual opinion)
