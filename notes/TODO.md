# Notes

## Short-term

    * vote on coalition contract (eval: who could reach how many of their goals?)
    * relative position in negotiations -> correlation with coalition "success"

    * stop criterium (what's a viable coalition?)
    * likelihood estimation
    * [opinion](opinion) weighting -> incl. how to compute (e.g. similarity?)

    -> apply to future elections

## Long-term

    * we need to define utility / payoff
        * distance between coalition opinion and initial party opinion (or initial individual opinion)
    * opinion variability within group  // DISCUSS -> probably later
    * aim at minimal coalition
        * seats in Bundestag as "currency"
    * add stubbornness (only move by one in every dimension)

* [ ] refactor conforms_to_schema function
* [ ] streamline up to model runs
* [ ] implement axelrod convergence criterion
* [ ] convergence have_consensus
* [ ] convergence can_form_government
* [ ] reward function (how close is the final consensus to the initial opinion?)
* [ ] weights for opinions
* [ ] interactive "walkthrough" create_params function
