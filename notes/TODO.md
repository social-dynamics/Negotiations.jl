# Next Steps

    * vote on coalition contract (eval: who could reach how many of their goals?)
    * relative position in negotiations -> correlation with coalition "success"

    * stop criterium (what's a viable coalition?)
    * likelihood estimation
    * opinion weighting -> incl. how to compute (e.g. similarity?)

    -> apply to future elections

# Notes

    * we need to define utility / payoff
        * distance between coalition opinion and initial party opinion (or initial individual opinion)


# Further Down the Road

    * opinion variability within group  // DISCUSS -> probably later



# Moved here from Code

TODO:
  * aim at minimal coalition
      * seats in Bundestag as "currency"
  * add stubbornness (only move by one in every dimension)
